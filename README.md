# effects_of_crude_oil_on_juvenile_threespine_stickleback_020719
Data and stats from 020719 experiment examining the effects of crude oil on juvenile threespine stickleback from Bear Paw Lake.
Abbreviations used:
exp - experiment
dpf - days post fertilization
snv - snout-vent length
ed - eye diameter
sbl - swim bladder length
sba - swim bladder area
To determine how crude oil affects the survival, development, and immune system in developing stickleback, fish were exposed to Alaska North Slope crude oil between 7 and 14 dpf, and then were moved to tanks with water free of crude oil for a two-week depuration period. Somatic measurements and the expression of two immune genes were measured at both 14 and 28 dpf to determine how oil exposure affects growth and immunity and whether fish growth can recover after two weeks of depuration.
